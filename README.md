# everyday_hacks_with_batch_cmd_scripts
Run customized tasks quickly on Windows to meet your unique demands. Avoid dependence on third-party apps. 

Learn scripting and tweak results to your liking. Never let your preference be drowned by limited availability of existing app choices.

## Usage

The scripts have been appended a .txt extension to prevent accidental modifications to your data. So that opening them brings up the script in a text editor to view, analyze and customize. Rename and remove the .txt filename extensions and run at your risk.

## Warning
