# everyday_hacks_with_batch_cmd_scripts
Run customized tasks quickly on Windows to meet your unique demands. Avoid dependence on third-party apps. 

Learn scripting and tweak results to your liking. Never let your preference be drowned by limited availability of existing app choices.

## Usage

For viewing, editing and analysis, explicitly open the files in a text editor. Editing in linux/unix and attempting to execute them in Windows may cause errors due to different line endings. Additionally, if you are a newbie checking out these scripts, it is expected you know the difference between reading, editing and executing a script.

## Warning
```diff
- Data loss
```
These scripts carry a strong possibility of data loss/ data modification which might be the intended purpose. Make sure you have a basic understanding before running these files.
The files as provided are execution-ready and could result in an accidental run when opened directly.

If you do not understand what it means to run a cmd/batch script, please do not run them. No liability or guarantee is provided.
